Goal
----

Ensure makers that open hardware is a better development model than traditional
proprietary models and using patents to enforce this.

Main points

* Open Hardware and patents are fundamentally incompatible
* Patents does rarely serve individual inventors or small companies
* Open Hardware is an excellent way of innovating
* NOT arguing for reforming the patent system
I believe it is thouroughly broken, but don't believe in fixing it
Instead I strive to build new, alternative sustainable ways to *make*

Outline
--------

- Who am I
- What are patents
- What is Open Hardware
- Why Open Hardware and patents are incompatible
- What is broken about patents
- How Open Hardware can help

* Electroproto
Researching end-to-end electronics prototyping machine
http://github.com/jonnor/electroproto
* Caveats: not a lawyer, have worked for companies which does have patents, currently do

What are Patents

* Time limited **monopoly** on an invention
*purpose* is to ensure inventions are available to the public (through detailed disclosure)
encourage "innovation"

* Patentability
novel, cannot be publically known already
inventive/non-obvious (to person in field)
useful/industrially applicable


What is Open Hardware

* Informed by Open Source Software and the 4 freedoms
use the thing, for any purpose
study how the thing works, and change it
redistribute copies (design and produced item)
distribute modified versions to others
* OSHW definition
"Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can 
study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design."
http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW
* Primarily about copyright licenses
* Does not explicitly mandate no patents (!!!)
* Brief mention of trademark; must not be breached when producing OSHW
"... obligation to make it clear that such products are not manufactured,
sold, warrantied, or otherwise sanctioned by the original designer
and also not to make use of any trademarks owned by the original designer."

* Open Source != non-commercial, full freedom to *sell* open hardware products
AdaFruit, SparkFun, Seeed Studios, Olimex, Ultimaker, Arduino, Dangerous Prototypes, LittleBits

* Typically loose collaboration of people (potentially from different companies),
guided by central people "maintainers" (sometimes inside one company)



Broken patents


* Having a patent is not protection
need willingness+ability to sue, take legal expense risk
major distraction from day-to-day business, *making*
* No requirement that you make use of patent
get trolls "non-practicing entities"
buying companies with useless products or bankrupt for the patents
* Not enough time spent on checking patents
bad patents gets through. overly broad, vague
TODO: ex
* Litigation takes insane amounts of time+money
forces companies to settle even when they did not breach patent
good business for almost threats "shake-down"
* Mutually assured destruction
Large companies are amassing patents
When someone sues them over patents, they countersue
If you don't have patents to defend yourself, pay up
TODO: ex, Nokia vs Apple? or Apple versus HTC
* Competing in court instead of market
Possible to block import/sales of product
used for stalling competitors
http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/11/07/interesting-number-microsoft-makes-five-times-more-out-of-android-than-it-does-windows-phone/
* Patents valid for 15-30 years
In that time we will be likely solving different problems,
or solutions will need to be different to adapt to changed situation
blocks companies for doing new innovation in fear of patent "ghosts" or incumbents
* First to file
Right to patent is first person who files,
regardless of when the invention was made
* Independent discovery does not help
You invent something independently, possibly years later,
but still might be prevented from using invention due to patent
* No disclosure required about settlements
Public and other companies left in the dark
about which patents are being actively asserted
and what results of threats/settlements where

FDM 3d-printing
http://www.google.com/patents/US5121329
how much development happened between 1992-2008, how many companies active
how many had access to 3d-printers in 2008
how many have access to 3d-printer now
how many


Defending

* Stay non-commercial
Unlikely to get sued because no money to extract
Cheap access to information and equipment makes realistic,
benefits of open maker culture
* Defensive publications, submitting prior art
http://www.linuxdefenders.org/
IP.com database
* Invent around patents
Search databases before productizing
If infringing patents are found
* Join non-aggressive patent pools
OIN http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/
* Apply for patents, promise to not use agressively

RedHat

alternative/complimentary, patent grant in open source license
* Support patent reform

Strategic Open Hardware

* Published designs/code as prior art for patents
* Direct connection between problem/user and solution/company
* Forming companies, recruiting from contributors
TheGrid, 10 engineers, 7 timezones, 6 native languages
I got hired due to demonstrating usefulness in open project
give people a test project
* Leadership due to visibility
First mover advantage. Get it, maintain it
I've been asked to consult by random people because they have
seen my expertice in code/projects
* Robustness in case of company failure
Employees (or others) can take idea onwards!
