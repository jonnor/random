Goal
----

Main points

- 
- Open Hardware and patents are fundamentally incompatible
- 
- NOT arguing for reforming the patent system
I believe it is thouroughly broken, but don't believe in fixing it
Instead I strive to build new, alternative sustainable ways to *make*

Outline
--------

- Who am I
- What are patents
- What is Open Hardware
- What is broken about patents
- How Open Hardware can help

/whois

* Electronics + SW engineer. Hacker, maker
* Open Source + Linux.
* MyPaint, painting speedups.

* imgflo

* Electroproto
Researching end-to-end electronics prototyping machine

* Caveats: not a lawyer, have worked for companies which does have patents, currently do

What are Patents

* Time limited monopoly on an invention
*purpose* is to ensure inventions are available to the public (through detailed disclosure)
encourage "innovation"

* What you can pa


What is Open Hardware

* OSHW definition, http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW
* Primarily about copyright licenses
* Does not mandate no patents (!!!)
* Brief mention of trademark, must not be breached when producing OSHW
* Open Source != non-commercial, full freedom to sell open hardware products
* Typically loose collaboration of people, guided by central people "maintainers"

Broken patents

* Having a patent is not protection
need willingness+ability to sue
major distraction from business, *making*
* No requirement that you make use of patent
get trolls "non-practicing entities"
buying companies with useless products or bankrupt for the patents
* Not enough time spent on checking patents
bullshit patents gets through
* Litigation takes insane amounts of time+money
forces companies to settle even when they did not breach patent
good business for almost mafia-style "protection money"
* Possible to block import/sales of product -> used for stalling competitors
* Patents valid for 20-30 years
In that time we will be solving different problems,
or 
blocks companies for doing new innovation in fear of patent "ghosts" or incumbents

FDM 3d-printing

how much development happened between 1992-2008, how many companies active
how many had access to 3d-printers in 2008
how many have access to 3d-printer now
how many


Strategic Open Hardware

* Prior art
* Visible leader
