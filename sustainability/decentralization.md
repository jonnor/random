# Challenges

Supporting circular local economy, when having to compete with global centralized.
Have a sister-site from the start, exchange goods & skills. Allows some specialization in non-essentials

Impose customs for goods originating from outside? 30%?
Recognition that self-reliance is a goal. Use money for funding projects increasing self-reliance
