The earth can provide 1.7 [global hectare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_hectare) gha per person.
In Norway the average person consumptes 4.5 gha, or nearly 3 times the capability.

1 hectare of land is 100x100 = 10'000 m2. A given hectare of land may be measured in equivalent global hectares.

[StackExchange: Cultivation area to feed 1 person](http://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1433/how-large-a-cultivation-area-to-feed-one-person),
gives answers of 100-700 m^2, all assuming a vegetarian diet, and soil-based gardening.



With a fully closed hydroponics system, how much space would this take?
For instance use shipping containers. One 40ft container has 25 m^2 floorspace.
How much energy costs would this require, and how much area would this take?

What would the investment and upkeep costs?
How many years before the system would pay itself back?

How many hours of labor?
