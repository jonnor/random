The earth can provide 1.7 [global hectare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_hectare) gha per person.
In Norway the average person consumptes 4.5 gha, or nearly 3 times the capability.

1 hectare of land is 100x100 = 10'000 m2. A given hectare of land may be measured in equivalent global hectares.

Possible strategies:

* Increase effective area. Vertical farming
* Increase crop yield. Hydroponics
* Make use of arid lands. Hydroponics
* Make use of the ocean. Hydroponics+desalination?

[How many people can you feed per sqkm](http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/9582/how-many-people-can-you-feed-per-square-kilometer-of-farmland)


[StackExchange: Cultivation area to feed 1 person](http://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/1433/how-large-a-cultivation-area-to-feed-one-person),
gives answers of 100-700 m^2, all assuming a vegetarian diet, and soil-based gardening.



With a fully closed hydroponics system, how much space would this take?
For instance use shipping containers. One 40ft container has 25 m^2 floorspace.
How much energy costs would this require, and how much area would this take?

What would the investment and upkeep costs?
How many years before the system would pay itself back?

How many hours of labor?

75 kvm

10x shipping containers


Food costs 

* [The cost of US foods as related to their nutritive value](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2954450) (2010 Aug, USA).
Analysis of cost versus calories, and cost versus nutritional value.

Figure 3.
Mean cost per 100 kcal is from 0.2 USD for grains to 0.7 USD for fruits and vegetables.
For a 2000 kcal daily average, this is 4 - 14 USD per day.

> Water is the main determinant of energy density of foods.
> Whereas dry grains are energy dense, low-energy-density lettuce is 96% water.
> As noted above, larger serving sizes (RACC values) were strongly and positively
> linked to the foods’ water content (Spearman's r = 0.68).
> However, even though a serving of lettuce (85 g) weighs more than a serving of grains (30 g),
> it is not clear that the lettuce provides more “food” (2).
> Water, which has no nutrients or energy, is not generally recognized as “food.”
> 
>  Arguably, subsidies to commodity crops (wheat, soybeans, corn), as opposed to vegetables and fruit,
> have led to increasingly cheap calories and a food supply that is energy rich but nutrient poor (16).
> The current disparity in food prices is not an algebraic artifact but the result of long-established agricultural policies

Most meals are well below 0.01/kcal or 1 USD per 100kcal.
Many items are around 0.5 USD per 100kcal,
some look to be as low as 0.25 USD per 100 kcal.

Subs are in range from 0.6 USD per 100kcal to 1.6 USD per 100kcal. 

In Barcelona, it looks doable for eat less a 5 EUR/day on groceries, primarily wheat-based.
Assuming 2000 kcal, this is 0.25 EUR / 1000 kcal. Less than 2000 EUR yearly.
Can one replace 10% of this with own produced goods at a similar cost? 200 EUR, 73000 kcal.

Potatoes is an easy-to-grow calorie-dense. 770 kcal per kg. About 100 kg of potatoes??!
Or about 20 kg of wheat, rice or corn.
Potato bucket/tower/barrel seems popular with home-growers.
Plant with a bit of soil in the bottom, then top it up as the plants grow.
Often using standard plastic containers. These seem to potentially obscure a lot of light in early phase? 
Some use home-made wooden towers. No CNC-designs seem to be readily available?
