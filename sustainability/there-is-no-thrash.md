Currently we produce a lot of 'thrash', undesirable by- or end-products, that must be gotten rid of.
Instead we should see these products as possible inputs to new, or old processes which makes something of use.


# Undesirables

* CO2. Can
* Methane. Can be used to make biopolymers via bacteria.
* Cardboard, boxes etc. Cheap, lightweight sheet-material
* Plastic, bottles and containers.

# Ideas

## Cardboard


Pros

* Lightweight
* Relatively large pieces
* Relatively strong, for its weight
* Easy to cut with machine. Lasercutter, CNC/dragknife
* Easily bent into shapes
* Easy to cut/shape by hand
* Reasonably standardized thicknesses

Challenges:

* Very low resistance to water. Becomes soft and wears quickly
* Often comes as a box, multiple sides/sheets put together
* Very varying in size
* Often has plastic on it, packaging tape/labeling etc.
* Very flammable
* Different strength depending on flute direction

Existing

* [Wikkelhouse](http://www.wikkelhouse.com). Microhouse based on sections with an insulated core of cardboard,
made by wrapping around a frame.
"Cardboard is so undervalued material. There is no other building material is so light, strong and insulating.
Most people think of cardboard as a box or a packet of mail. Each tries himself to reason that it cannot be a cardboard house.
But it can be excellent. We are just not used to it yet."
* [Shigeru Ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Ban#Use_of_paper_as_a_building_material), arcitect working a lot with cardboard/paper,
especially cardboard tubes.
* [Corrugated Cardboard Pod](http://www.ruralstudio.org/projects/corrugated-cardboard-pod), small house using stacked strips of corrugated cardboard as walls.

Techniques

* Cross-laminate for increased strength. Can it be used structurally? Does it need glue?
* Laminate/foil with plastic bags for waterproofing. Using a ironing iron?
* Coat/soak with epoxy/resin for stiffness/waterproofing. Is it cost effective?
* Laminate and use as a core, with resin/textile as outer layers. Structural use with insulation?

Research:

* What is the standard/status-quo in reuse/recycling of cardboard?
"The  recovery  ratio  for  corrugated cardboard in Japan is was 84.4% in 1997, 85.9% in 1998, 88.8% in 1999, and 93.4%"
* How to fire-proof it?

Refuse. Don't get unneccesary things, even if they are freebies.
Reduce. Only get what you really need.
Reuse. 
Repurpose
Recycle. 

The earlier in this chain one is able to intervene, the more effectful.
Recycling is a last resort, but still orders of magnitude better than not doing anything.
