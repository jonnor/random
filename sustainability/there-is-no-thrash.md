Currently we produce a lot of 'thrash', undesirable by- or end-products, that must be gotten rid of.
Instead we should see these products as possible inputs to new, or old processes which makes something of use.


# Undesirables

* CO2. Can
* Methane. Can be used to make biopolymers via bacteria.
* Cardboard, boxes etc. Cheap, lightweight sheet-material
* Plastic, bottles and containers.
* 

# Ideas

## Cardboard

Pros

* Lightweight
* Relatively large pieces
* Relatively strong, for its weight
* Easy to cut with machine. Lasercutter, CNC/dragknife
* Easily bent into shapes
* Easy to cut/shape by hand

Challenges:

* Very low resistance to water. Becomes soft and wears quickly
* Often comes as a box, multiple sides/sheets put together
* Very varying in size
* Often has plastic on it, packaging tape/labeling etc.
* Very flammable


Techniques

* Cross-laminate for increased strength. Can it be used structurally? Does it need glue?
* Laminate/foil with plastic bags for waterproofing. Using a ironing iron?
* Coat/soak with epoxy/resin for stiffness/waterproofing. Is it cost effective?
* Laminate and use as a core, with resin/textile as outer layers. Structural use with insulation?

Research:

* What is the standard/status-quo in reuse/recycling of cardboard?
* How to fire-proof it?

Refuse. Don't get unneccesary things, even if they are freebies.
Reduce. Only get what you really need.
Reuse. 
Repurpose
Recycle. 

The earlier in this chain one is able to intervene, the more effectful.
Recycling is a last resort, but still orders of magnitude better than not doing anything.
