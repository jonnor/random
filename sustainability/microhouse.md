Ideas
------

Dual/multi-purpose areas

* Functions which are not needed/utilized at the same time should be able to serve multiple purposes
* Should to take into account more than 1 person using the space. Could be 2 typically, 3 people occationally.
* Maybe integrate shower with toilet+sink into one cabinet that is "bathroom". Use water-tight compartments to keep toiletries+towel while showering.

Roof balcony

* Multiplies available space
* Can be used for storage, of bicycle/skis for instance.
* Can be used to plant/grow things
* Washing machine, and drying clothes
* Social space when more than a couple of people
* Challenge: Keeping water/snow from destroying roof, need good drainage.
* Let balcony be sparse floor, mounted on top of slanted roof?

Research topics
--------------

* Housing regulations in Norway, Scandiavia and EU.
* Regulations for trolley size etc. B1: ~750-1250kg, BE: 3500kg.
* Possible locations to keep a microhouse. Camping?
