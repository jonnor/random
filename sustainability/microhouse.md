Microhousing is an alternative, and counter-movement to the ever growing sizes of personal and family housing.

Activities
----------

That a house should accommodate.

* Sleeping
* Leisure
* Working
* Socializing
* Cooking
* Meta: Improving the house

Design for actual use. Currently in central Oslo apartment, I

* Spend most of my time at desk, in front of computer and 3d-printer.
* Sleep once a day ~8 hours, most days alone.
* Cook upward of 1 (hot) meal a day. Rest is bread+spread, cereal etc.
* Most meals doable with just 2 pots. Oven optional.
* I shower usually once a day. Spend less than 45 mins total in bathroom.
* I occationally have visitors, usually one, sometimes two.

Needs
------

* Bed, double sized.
* Guest sleeping surface.
* Good sized working surface / desk.
* Bathroom: Shower, toilet, sink
* Kitchen: Oven+stovetop, fridge+freezer, sink

Wants
------

* House to be transportable, for instance mounted on trolley
* Window looking out from working area
* Window looking out from sleeping area

Esthetics
--------

* Minimal
* Functional
* Post-modern?
* Tech meets nature

Ideas
------

Dual/multi-purpose areas

* Functions which are not needed/utilized at the same time should be able to serve multiple purposes
* Should to take into account more than 1 person using the space. Could be 2 typically, 3 people occationally.
* Maybe integrate shower with toilet+sink into one cabinet that is "bathroom". Use water-tight compartments to keep toiletries+towel while showering.

Roof balcony

* Multiplies available space
* Can be used for storage, of bicycle/skis for instance.
* Can be used to plant/grow things
* Washing machine, and drying clothes
* Social space when more than a couple of people
* Challenge: Keeping water/snow from destroying roof, need good drainage.
* Let balcony be sparse floor, mounted on top of slanted roof?

Research topics
--------------

* Housing regulations in Norway, Scandiavia and EU.
* Regulations for trolley size etc. B1: ~750-1250kg, BE: 3500kg.
* Possible locations to keep a microhouse. Camping?
* Contruction methods

Documentation
--------------

* Each solution should be documented well enough to be usable stand alone
* Include rationale, constraints and inspirations

Subsystems
-----------

Electricity

* Budget: 200 watts average, with non-electic heating
* Regular: Computer/phone

CleanWater

* Capture rainwater?
* Storage needed. Many use 300-400 liters. Tanks can hopefully go outside.
* waterHavested (liter) = roofArea (m2) * rainfall (mm) * 0.8 (collection factor). 25mm/30days @ 15m2 = 10 l/daily. Minimum?

Hotwater

* For showering, cleaning dishes
* 5L/day enough?
* Heating on stove probably easiest

Heating

* Source. Wood? Gas? Electric?
* Distribution. Airflow. Waterbourne?


Cooking

* Power source. Wood? Gas? Electricity is off if to be off-grid capable.

Storage

* Clothing
* Bicycle
* 

Location
----------

Common

* Not needing a car. Public transportation access to city/airport. Biking/walking distance to grocery store.
* Ease of travelling to Norway/EU
* + Opportunities to swim and bike/hike nearby

Oslo-ish, Norway

* - Cold in winter
* - Expensive plots
* + Known language
* + Secure/stable environment

Balkans

* Croatia/Serbia/Montenegro
* Should be close to sea, walking distance.
* + Temperate climate
* + Cheap-ish plots
* Maybe ability to rent out in season. Croatian tourism regulations quite strict however
* Plot listings [Montenegro](http://www.montenegroprospects.com/property/page/9/?st=property&s&t_region=--&t_property_type=--&price_from=--&price_to=50000)
* Agricultural land over 3300sqm in Croatia can build house on
* Islands of Brac, Hvar, Korcula, Vis all have ferry/boat connection to Split center. Plots `< 20000EUR`
* (smaller) islands Otto Sipan, Lopud and Kolocep are connected to Dubrovnik.
* Connections to islands outside Pula/Rijeka (Cres/Losinj) seems less developed

"|as an opensource community|, why don't have we done anything about housing?"
aligns the Napster->Spotify with situation of building codes.
vested interests in having housing be expensive: large profitably industry, expensive housing (incl utilities and mortage) is a basis for tax.
Goal of free software movement is to ensure freedom -> but we're still limited by physicals.
"we're (opensource) winning in software, making good inways in electronics, and gadgets. Need to move into basic physical infrastructure: housing, watersupply, energy".
What if we could have a 200-500 people nomadic village built of hackers, with open source infrastructure shipped around in containers.
