### CO2 enrichment
Using CO2 produced by burning firewood, fermenting or decomposing organic matter to increase plant growth.
Up to double the growth rate by going from 300ppm CO2 to 800-1600 ppm concentration.
If a byproduct of other neccesities can greatly enhance effecivity.
Like from heating house, or decomposing matter unsuited for production when cutting down wood).

CO2 should be fed above plants, as CO2 is significantly hotter than air. Links to test/monitoring tools.


## Hydroponics

### Growth medium

Inorganic like expanded clay "lava rocks" or Perlite seems the way to go.

### Water level sensor

Can use capacitive sensor to mesasure water level, and thus have closed-loop control?
Especially useful for Ebb & flow.
Should be possible to make such a sensor with alu/copper foil/tape covered by plastics.

Being able to control water could also be used to periodically move water into a measurment chamber,
for EC/PH. Can maybe allow cheaper sensors, as frequently constant water will degrade sensors.

### Measuring Electrical Conducance

Perhaps a capacitive sensing can also be used as non-contact method for electrical conductance (EC) of water?
EC is related to how much nutrients/salts are in the water, and desirable to control (after PH). Ref:
[Conductivity Effect on the Capacitance Measurement of a Parallel-Plate Capacitive Sensor System](http://www.maxwellsci.com/print/rjaset/v3-53-60.pdf).

### Measuring PH

Complex sensor unit. Probably best to go with a standard commercial one.
The fidelity is much better than typically needed though, so maybe there are some hacks possible.

### Oxygen

* [DIY Simple Aeration for Hydroponics - Venturi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO_tXS-uZMk).
Very simple, adding a side-tube connection to water tank return tube to suck in air.
* [DIY venturi, a few easy builds for aquaponics, aquaculture or hydroponics..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZMjDgM3LaU).
Using a T-connector with a side-tube dipped into the stream. An angle in the inserted tube is used to create the low-pressure+turbulence.
A reduction of the pipe diameter in the helps as flow-rate is increased.
A valve on the air intake can be used to adjust.
