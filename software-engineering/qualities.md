Some ideas about what makes good software, and how to make good software.

# Qualities of software

Good software is 1) valuable to people 2) easy to change to become more valuable.
Everything else is at best secondary, and *means* to help achieve the above,
not goals of their own.

This is an utilitarian notion, of software as a tool, a means, for solving other problems.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

["nanos gigantum humeris insidentes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants).
Often quoted used in free software movement, referring to how one builds on top of work done by others.
But the flip-side is not so much acknowledged, that someone needs to build things in a way
that is suitable for others to build upon. To *be a shoulder for others to stand upon*.

This has implications for how software is constructed, its architecture, interfaces and
their reliability and stability.
