How to make hardware as easy as software?
It is all done with EDA tools (which are software),
digital-fabrication machines can do large amounts of manufacturing (which are software controlled).

In software world, one can create usecase-specific programs
by including a set of libraries, and then only having to
add the glue that goes between them.
Electronics one mostly has to research, schemaify and lay out every
single part - even when trying to reuse existing circuits, modules.
Comes from app note PDFs, reference circuits in datasheets.

## Notes from OSHW 2014

From [Open Hardware Summit 2014, Rome](http://2014.oshwa.org/) unconference on *Making Open Hardware Scale*.

[Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17laLM8CJIrpnUkXHXsCj8pGjNrwcg1uGi6cjrWV8Ps8/edit?usp=sharing)

Improve the process in going from a prototype created from stock breakouts/shields,
to custom board(s) more suitable for low to medium scale manufacturing.

Current workflow
* Take OSHW breakout boards , build prototype (great)
When integrating into custom board:
* Copy in the schematics of breakouts, wire together manually (problem1)
* Redo the layout from scratch (problem2)

Idea: allow to define reusable functional blocks (components) and systems composed of such components.

Components include everything needed to use realize the system, on at least two levels:
1) Prototype: as breakout board and their connectors
2) Custom board: schematics+layout snippets

Next steps:
* Prototype software solution that allows defining components,
and plugging them together into a bigger design and get a PCB out
Possibly based on Fritizing or Upverter
* Interact with OSHW distributors who sell breakouts/baseboards etc,
SparkFun/Adafruit/Arduino
â€“ find out if they would help in contributing to component library

## Interfaces

We think of different pieces of a circuit as "components" with well-defined interfaces.
To be able to plug two components together, in a meaningful way their interfaces must be compatible.
Similarly, to swap out one component for another, they must be compatible.

There are leveral aspect/levels to this.

* Physical
* Electrical
* Functional

For instance, two practically identical components may have different physical layout.
Like an IC available both in through-hole DIP socket, and smaller surface-mounted SO/TSOP/MSSOP.
Such differences should be possible to let the 'compiler' handle automatically,
as in most cases it would not impact on functionality.

Two components may be functionally/semantically the same, but have different electrical interface.
Example one microcontroller operates on 3.3v and another (of equivalent kind) operate on 5v,
neccitating to convert between these two levels for digital I/O between them.
A smart 'compiler' may also allow to inject the needed adapters.
Automatically or proposed with human confirmation.

Many times there are functionally equivalent components available, that are not identical.
For instance, in many simple analog filter circuits, an LM358 and TL072 opamps might be practically equivalent.
However, if there are particular requirements on input impedance, noiselevel, DC offset or voltage
- this may not be the case.
This suggests that functional equivalence is a problem-specific property, and that to
offer strategies to adapt between these cases, the compiler needs to be aware of
the particular *constraints* of the circuit.

## Proof of concept

Example project

* Microcontrolller
* on/off switches MOSFET
* Voltage regulator

Use KiCAD as base?

* Each module own github repo
* Similart import to Part library wizard
* Module is a schematic, set of layout variants, and a file file declaring the module (connecting these files)
* From module/layout, generate a footprint, that can be used in a project

Second-degree

* BOM generation, can be a script which picks up schematics and parts

"Continious delivery"

* All tools should run on commandline
* git submodules as dependencies?
* Single-source of information
