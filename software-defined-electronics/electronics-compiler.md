How to make hardware as easy as software?
It is all done with EDA tools (which are software),
digital-fabrication machines can do large amounts of manufacturing

In software world, one can create usecase-specific programs
by including a set of libraries, and then only having to
add the glue that goes between them.
Electronics one mostly has to research, schemaify and lay out every
single part - even when trying to reuse existing.
Comes from app note PDFs, reference circuits in datasheets.
'dead tree' representations

```
Module system
    Libraries
    Open source
    Searchable
    Installable with 1 click
    Standarized formats
    Defined interfaces
    Pluggable
Compiler
    Different targets
    Modules which plug together
    Fully custom/monolithic board
    Board with modules represented, w/possibility of breaking them apart
Optimizations
    'inlining'
    size, costs, performance

Automated testing
    Simulated
    Hardware
