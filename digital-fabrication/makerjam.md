A *maker jam* would be a

Similar to concept of a [Game jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam)

## Goals

* Make more open source, globally reproducible, designs
* Connect makers locally, and globally
* Train people to publish reproducible designs, to *work in the open*.

## Format

Global event, but with focus on local hubs (typically hacker/makerspace/fablab or similar).
Time limited, for instance held in a weekend.
Participats make something, *document it* and submits this to a "competition".
Purpose of competition is to encourage people to not abandon their design before published.
Main category would be for something that has been designed & made & tested.
Secondary category for concept/design-only?
People can work alone or in teams (encouraged).
Using existing designs as basis ('derivatives') is fine, as long as:
The original work is specified (and linked to), and there are documented improvements/changes to.
People can submit as many designs as they'd like.

Each jam would have a particular theme or problem-area

Example:

* Fabrication of clothes
* Kitchen utensils 'cooking'
* Music instruments
* Energy production
* Food production
* Automated (specialized) manufacturing
* Sleeping

Maybe announce the theme, say 1 month before.

Maybe have a video-presentation 'opening'

Favor asyncronous communication, over syncronous.
Favor persistent commuicatation over temporal.
Mailing list, chat (IRC etc), linked video snippets, linked images/project files.

Important that people can organize such event themselves.
Well documented, people can take ownership. Self-selection in participation
Event should travel around, varied venues.

## TODO

* Research similar existing events in 'maker' scene
* Figure out relevant communication/dissemination channels
* Maybe try out defining format and doing 'internal' hackathon
Maybe do a test at Nordic hackathon in Lyngen?
