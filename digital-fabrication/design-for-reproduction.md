# Motivation
Prevalence of 3d-printers.
FDM, RepRap

File can and are shared online
sites like Uimagine, Thingiverse

Lack of best practices in design and mechanical engineering,
tatilored for these machines,
and for making objects which are not useful just for oneself,
but for everyone with access to a similar machine,
no matter where they are in the world

Ease of reproduction.
Globally, rural/urban


# Topics

General FDM printing considerations

* Oversize holes
* Printable without support
* Direction of print influences strength

Consideration for ease-of-reproduction

* Consider build sizes. Limit to ? 170x170mm when possible.
* Limit number of parts
* Limit number of required vitamins.
When desirable to use vitamins (for performance), consider vitamin-free
* Limit non-standard vitamins
* Provide both metric and imperial versions
* Provide source/project files!!
* Design parts with cross-platform, gratis and libre software. So people can actually use the sources
OpenSCAD, FreeCAD
* Complex print-in-place discouraged
* Parts vunerable to wear and/or damage should be replacable individually

Licensing

* Open source definition
* Share Alike versus not
* Problems with NonCommercial, including grey areas

Documentation

* Explain what the part does, how it works. Video is nice!
* Slicing instructions
* How to assemble part
* Calculations for selecting particular geometry (ie for gears etc)


Specific designs

* Combining parts together
Joinery
* Movable parts
Hinges, springs, axels
Parallelogram, pivots
Gears, sprockets, belts

Aesthetics

* Using characteristic of the media. Example: visible layers, effects of changing heating
* Uniqueness, generative designs
