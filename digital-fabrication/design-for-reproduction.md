# Motivation
Prevalence of digital-fabrication tools, especially 3d-printers but also laser-cutter/CNC.
FDM, RepRap

File can and are shared online
sites like Uimagine, Thingiverse

Lack of best practices in design and mechanical engineering,
tatilored for these machines,
and for making objects which are not useful just for oneself,
but for everyone with access to a similar machine,
no matter where they are in the world

Ease of reproduction.
Globally, rural/urban

# Format
To put it on the agenda. Primarily a manifesto/reference?
Online. Single page, smple list of the most important points.
Possibly with links to more detailed explanations (can come later).
Should be concrete (easy to determine if in compliance)
and actionable (provide neccesary info to come into compliance).
Should be possible to evaluate a project according to each point, and
come up with a rough (subjective is fine) score.

Could also have concrete do's and don'ts, but this will require
much more work to assemble and maintain.
Possibly better to split out as separate resource? For instance (e-)books
on design-for-reproducability for particular technologies (machine type, CAD software)...


# Topics

General FDM printing considerations

* Oversize holes
* Printable without support
* Direction of print influences strength

Consideration for ease-of-reproduction

* Consider build sizes. Limit to ? 170x170mm when possible.
* Limit number of parts
* Limit number of required vitamins.
When desirable to use vitamins (for performance), consider vitamin-free
* Limit non-standard vitamins
* Provide both metric and imperial versions
* Provide source/project files!!
* Design parts with cross-platform, gratis and libre software. So people can actually use the sources
OpenSCAD, FreeCAD
* Complex print-in-place discouraged
* Parts vunerable to wear and/or damage should be replacable individually

Licensing

* Open source definition
* Share Alike versus not
* Problems with NonCommercial, including grey areas

Documentation

* Explain what the part does, how it works. Video is nice!
* Slicing instructions
* How to assemble part
* Calculations for selecting particular geometry (ie for gears etc)

Dissemination

* Put your design up on common sharing sites, even if they are not the main project location.
Ex: Umagine, Thingiverse

Specific designs

* Combining parts together
Joinery
* Movable parts
Hinges, springs, axels
Parallelogram, pivots
Gears, sprockets, belts

Aesthetics

* Using characteristic of the media. Example: visible layers, effects of changing heating
* Uniqueness, generative designs
