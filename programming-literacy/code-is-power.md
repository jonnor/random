http://adaptstudio.ca/analog/ (November 19, 2014) opens the question of why would we consider
'code literacy'[1] a key literacy, in response to Sir Tim Berners-Lee arguing
that politicians regulating software should be code literate.


I'd like to offer some arguments for programming as key literacy,
though not neccesarily in support of Tim Berners-Lee statement.

First, I'd argue that most people would get by fine without basic numeracy (at least in countries like Norway).
You don't need to add, subtract nor multiply or divide to buy food or pay your bills.
Computers compute the numbers for you, you accept or reject, and pay with creditcard or internet banking.
Few use personal budgeting, at least in any formal sense. Should we stop teaching numeracy for this reason?

No, it would increase power disparity between those who do know it and the general population.
It would make it easier to cheat people by deliberate manipulation of numbers for instance
(not that this does not happen now in more subtle ways).
Harder for people to critizice and to come up with alternatives.

Many things changed during the mechanical industrial revolution, though some things stayed the same.
Many went being serfs on the field to serfs in the factory.
So far, we have continued the tradition and become serfs in the walled gardens of the Internet.

Would widespread understanding of mechanical machines have changed this?
Perhaps not, it requires substantial amounts of capital to build machines,
and the introduction of "intellectual property" made illegal many ways of using such knowledge (nice timing).
But these are not arguments to not increasing literacy, just acknowledgement that
literacy (in this area) alone may not be enough.

There are however some traits of programs that make the understanding of how to create them
particularly powerful.

* Universal. In the physical world we are bound by many laws of nature that do not apply in a program.
Unlike a mechanical machine, a computer program can be made to execute almost anything we can think of.
A computer with appropriate programs can be a printing press, library, book-of-ledgers,
radio station, movie studio and much more.
* Available. Thanks much to its universality, most of us have computers in the house
 and working place. Increasingly we carry one with us at all times[2]. A 2013 smartphone has
10-100 times the computing power of IBM Deep Blue (first computer to beat the best humans at chess, 1997).
* Knowledge-building. Programs lend themselves well to testing theories (formal or informal), gaining
new knowledge about the problem. We can also use the knowledge gained to build better programs.
* Transportable. A computer program can be transported, without loss in fidelity and at very low cost,
across the world in a split second. Allows many others apart from only the original creator to benefit. 
* Capital un-intensive. Given availability of computing, the creation of programs requires primarily knowledge and time.

The increasing embedding of programs into physical devices,
and digital fabrication systems which share many of above traits (like 3d-printers),
brings the potential and power of programs to the physical world.

Computer programs have come to dominate modern technology, and the trend looks to continue.
The extremely uneven distribution of programming literacy has helped consentrate the power of programs
in a few places, both geographically and demographically, into the hands of a self-selected few.

The illiterate can only accept the conclusions of their books.
We cannot read the words, nor write books of our own.


It is this I hope regulators realize and aim to amend.

----------
1. I refrain from using the term 'code', because it is too tightly coupled with
a specific way of programming (popular today): using manipulation of text symbols
indirectly representing the program, telling the computer exactly how to perform its task.
This is not the only way of programming. A paradigm shift might be neccesary for programming literacy
to reach its potential.
2. Sadly many of these computers are blocked from being user programmable, especially Apple iOS devices.
