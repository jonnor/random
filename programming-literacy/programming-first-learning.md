An attempt to re-think the definition of programming literacy

Background
------------

Currently we teach kids to read and write (natural language) first,
along with mathematics, then we learn "the rest" of subjects *through* these skills.
physics, biology, geography, history, art, music, etc.

In parallel we develop and improve the natural language and maths skills,
both for its own sake and to enable learning of more complex material in other subjects.
At some point, usually around grade 4 we start to learn a second language,
and in middle school a third.

Less conciously perhaphs, we also teach visual language.

Learning about the computer is mostly limited to looking up information,
primarily in natural language or visual form (images, video).

Programming is normally taught only at high-school, and as a subject of its own,
something to learn and use, but not primarily for further learning in other subjects
In other words, it is not treated as *literacy* the way natural language & maths is.

Experiment
-----------

What would happen if one were to teach kids programming starting at the same
age as natural and visual language, and following a similar progression?

TODO: add details/scenarios


Discussion
----------

The idea of learning a subject *through* programming might be seen as somewhat
backwards and uncessesary complicated, even to computer scientists and software engineers.
But perhaps this implies that even we are not truely programming literate?

It is likely that current technology for creating, running and exploring programs
is not particularly suited for such an approach.
We also do not have established curriculum of topics, evaluation methods and learning materials
like texts, example programs and similar.
We likely also need to develop the best practices around forming such.
This is unsuprising, as it has not been seen as a goal to pursue so far.

Chosing an initial programming language is bound to be a tricky problem.
Unlike natural language, there is not so many natural choices. Governments and muncipalities
don't have "official programming languages" and kids don't speak with their parents using
a programming language "native tounge".
Given time however, if such an approach to teaching programming is widely adopted,
it is theoretically possible that such concepts will emerge.

Another complicating factor is the interests of the computer technology industry.
A vendor promoting a certain programming language would benefit massively
if students were to learn it during normal education, so there is large economic incentive
for capture.

In terms of literacy, the goal of learning programming is however not to be useful in-itself,
but that it is useful for learning about new subjects and developing new knowledge.
This perhaps suggests a departure from conventional programming languages and that using
an established "useful" language from a vendor is a non-goal.
