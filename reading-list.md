> Instead, pay attention to two things:
> 1. The things that you are drawn to which allow you to use your skills and life experiences in the most effective possible way.
> 2. The things that you know will have a *clear and positive impact* on *real people* *who you care about*.


## Inventing on Principle
Seen: February 21, 2016 (possibly once before too?)

[Bret Victor - Inventing on principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII)

Bretts working on ideas and getting them out into the world.
Principle: Creators needs *immediate* connection with what they create.

> So much of creation is discovery

Need to explore a lot in order to discover.

Example: Mario-like platformer.

* Time control/travel.
* Both back-forward manually,
* but also ability to seeing whole 'alternate universe' timelines from changing the code.

> People who are software engineers are just people very good at 'playing computer',
> envisioning what the computer will do with a given piece of code.

Example: Binary search

* Show actual values, including that of loops

Example: Analog electronics design

* Scrubbing through data inspectors to see matching/corresponding data in others
* Comparing two edges by clicking on one inspector. Shadow shown all other inspectors.

> Why do we have these squiggly symbols (electronics notation).
> Because they are easy to write on paper.
> But a computer is not paper.
> It is new medium, and we need to revisit these ideas.

> REPL are considered interactive programming - because its the best thing we can do on a teletype...

> I think about the millions of pieces [ideas] that are locked in peoples heads.
> [because the tools need to express them are not available]
> ...
> When I see a violation of [my principle]... [it hurts].. [a tragedy]
> I feel it my *responsibility* to do something about it
> .. Activist lifestyle, dedicate yourself to fighting for a cause
> Not just for social activist. They typically fight by organising.
> You can *fight by inventing*.

Did not just solve a problem, but also discovered/created the problem - that noone else saw.
Recognised a wrong which had been unacknowledges in society before.

Path of the craftsman: perfecting a skill.
Path of the problemsolver: go into a field, find a problem, solve it.
Path of the activist: find a principle and make it your cause.

How to find your principle?
Do many things. Use the experiences to find out what I care about.

Principles are diffent from ideas/thoughs because they are actionable.
Applied as a question, easily divides scenarios into a yes or no.


## We're doing everything wrong
Seen: February 21, 2016

[We're Doing It All Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS1lpKBMkgg)
Paul Phillips, Pacific Northwest Scala 2013.

Key ideas

* Retricting expressiveness in language can make it more powerful,
in that tools/compilers can optimize for that usecase/task.
* Maybe a family of tools/languages instead of a "general purpose" one
* AST as canonical representation, not text.
* Changes (to code) as the primary input. Incremental build/verifiation

Some work on code-as-AST

* (maybe) [Jetbrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/)


## Improvind Our Ability to Improve

[Improving Our Ability to Improve: A Call for Investment in a New Future](http://www.almaden.ibm.com/coevolution/pdf/engelbart_paper.pdf).
Dr. Douglas Engelbart, IBM Co-Evolution Symposium, September 24 2003

> ...we are not yet really making good progress 
> toward realizing the really substantial payoff that is possible.  That payoff will come 
> when we make better use of computers to bring *communities of people together* and to 
> *augment the very human skills* that people bring to bear on *difficult problems*.


> We need to move beyond understanding the computer as some 
> kind of fancy printing machine and begin to
> use it to analyze and manipulate the 
> symbolic content of our work, extending our
> own capabilities.

> The feature of humans that makes us most human â€“ that most clearly 
> differentiates us from every ot
> her life form on Earth â€“ is not our opposable thumb, and 
> not even our use of tools. It is our ability to
> create and use symbols.
