Dr. Douglas Engelbart, IBM Co-Evolution Symposium, September 24 2003

> ...we are not yet really making good progress 
> toward realizing the really substantial payoff that is possible.  That payoff will come 
> when we make better use of computers to bring *communities of people together* and to 
> *augment the very human skills* that people bring to bear on *difficult problems*.


> We need to move beyond understanding the computer as some 
> kind of fancy printing machine and begin to
> use it to analyze and manipulate the 
> symbolic content of our work, extending our
> own capabilities.

> The feature of humans that makes us most human â€“ that most clearly 
> differentiates us from every ot
> her life form on Earth â€“ is not our opposable thumb, and 
> not even our use of tools. It is our ability to
> create and use symbols.
